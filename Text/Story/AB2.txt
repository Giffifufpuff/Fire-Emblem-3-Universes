## AB2Opening1

[OpenMidRight][LoadElle][OpenMidLeft][LoadMandel]
--frankly, a disgrace.[N]
Do I make myself clear, Miss Alfbern?[A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Yes, Councilwoman Mandel.[A][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidLeft]
You have disappointed all of us.[N]
Dismissed![A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadAlbinia]
If I may, Councilwoman.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight]

[OpenMidLeft]
What is it, Councilwoman Nouveau?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Please, we've been over this,[N]
just refer to me as Albinia.[A][N]
[Beat].[A][N]
Anyway, I just wanted to add that[N]
we mustn't be too hard on her.[A][N]
She's always worked hard for us.[A][N]
Isn't that right, Elle?[A]

[OpenRight]
Er, yes, Councilwo[Beat][A]

[OpenFarRight]
[Beat][A]

[OpenRight]
Albinia.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
All right, now you[N]
really are dismissed.[A][X]


## AB2Opening2

[OpenFarRight][LoadLazul][OpenMidLeft][LoadElle]
[OpenRight][LoadReginald]
How did it go, Lady Elle?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
About as badly as I feared.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Cheer up, Elle.[A][N]
You still might have a[N]
shot for the Council seat.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadBarrymore]
Wrong.[A][N]
They'll never overlook[N]
your grievous blunder.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
Your hopes of getting a spot on[N]
the Council are over, Miss Alfbern.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Councilman Barrymore.[N]
What are you doing here?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I just thought I'd come see how[N]
you're faring, Blade of the Council.[A][N]
It's a right shame your[N]
mission went the way it did.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive my mistrust,[A][N]
but you've never been one to pay[N]
any attention to my Amber Bears.[A][N]
I don't see what's so[N]
intriguing all of a sudden.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Oh, that.[A][N]
Well, you see,[A][N]
I have a little bit[N]
of an offer for you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I'm listening.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
With your current resources,[A][N]
you'll never be able to[N]
secure a spot on the Council.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Please tell me something[N]
I don't already know.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
However, it's only impossible with[N]
your current resources at hand.[A][N]
House Barrymore has quite a[N]
lot of resources, as you know.[A][N]
And as you also know,[N]
our last champion,[....] Mikey,[....][A][N]
met an unfortunate[N]
end a fortnight ago.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
So you are using a secret proxy.[N]
That's against the law, Councilman.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I'm very much aware.[A][N]
Though, tell me, what[N]
exactly can you do to me?[A][N]
Tell the Council[N]
I'm using proxies?[A][N]
It's your word against mine;[A][N]
they'll just see you as bitter and[N]
desperate in light of your failure.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat][A]

[OpenFarRight]
See?[A][N]
I always knew you were a smart girl.[A][N]
And our desires just happen to align.[A][N]
You want a seat on the Council,[N]
and I would like another one.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What's the point of being on the[N]
Council if I'm to obey your every whim?[A][N]
I'd just be your dog.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
You already are.[A][N]
When the Council tells[N]
you to do something,[A][N]
you do it with no questions asked.[A][N]
Tell me, Miss Alfbern,[A][N]
if that isn't what you'd[N]
consider to be a dog, what is?[A]

[OpenRight]
All right, that's enough.[A][N]
I will not stand around and let--[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Reginald.[....] It's fine.[A]

[OpenRight]
[Beat].[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
So?[A][N]
Let's say I agree to your terms.[A][N]
What will you have me do?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
It's simple enough, really.[A][N]
There have been rumors of[N]
rebellion in Olenvard.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Are you really so willing[N]
to send me off again,[A][N]
despite what happened the last time?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Oh, please. This won't be nearly as public.[A][N]
You can massacre the lot, as far as I care.[A][N]
The Council won't catch wind of it.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat][A][N]
Very well.[A][N]
I accept your terms.[A][X]


## AB2Opening3

[OpenFarLeft][LoadElle][OpenLeft][LoadReginald]
Lady Elle, this journey shall be more[N]
grueling than those we've had before.[A][N]
Olenvard is much further away[N]
from the Council headquarters.[A][N]
I suggest that we find some[N]
additional allies to aid us.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadNobody][MoveRight]
You were saying?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Ah, Nobody.[A][N]
I'm taking it you're joining us?[A]

[OpenRight]
Not just me. Occam too.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadOccam][MoveFarRight]
Yes?[A]

[OpenLeft]
Ah, it's good to see you two.[A]

[OpenRight]
Likewise.[A][N]
Butternut's colic[N]
seems to be cured,[A][N]
so I'm now free to[N]
return to my side duties.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Is[Beat]he talking about a horse?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
I believe so.[A]

[OpenRight]
Oh, and Lazul?[A]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadLazul]
H-Huh?[A]

[OpenRight]
Butternut misses you;[A][N]
you should pay her a[N]
visit when we get back.[A][X]


## AB2Opening4
[OpenMidRight][LoadElle]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadReginald]
[OpenLeft][LoadLazul]
Oh, it's so cold[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
Agreed.[A][N]
But there's nothing[N]
to be done about it.[A][N]
Let's get this finished[N]
quick so we can go back home.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Cold? I feel nothing.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
You maintain heat[N]
like a bear, Reginald.[A][N]
Though before we leave,[A][N]
I'd like to check[N]
something out.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Hm?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
There's supposed to be a[N]
gorgeous frozen lake nearby.[A][N]
You can see glimmering lights in[N]
the water through the ice, apparently.[A]

[OpenLeft]
R-really?![A][N]
Wow, that sounds amazing.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
It's just a view.[A][N]
There's no need to get excited.[A]

[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
Yes[Beat]you're right.[A][N]
S-sorry[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
Hm? We've arrived, you two.[A][X]

## AB2Opening5

[OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier][OpenMidLeft][LoadRynod]
At arms, men![A][N]
Why are you all looking so tired?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Just manning our posts, sir.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Bah! A bunch of whoresons, you are.[A][N]
Listen up![A][N]
If you see anyone who's an outsider,[N]
attack first, ask questions later.[A][N]
Am I clear?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Sir, yes sir![A][X]

## AB2Opening6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle]
What's this?[A][N]
This sleepy village is[N]
really nursing a rebellion?[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadReginald]
Lady Elle,[A][N]
it looks like the villagers are actually[N]
at the mercy of a group of unsavory folk.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What in damnation is[N]
Barrymore playing at?[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
That dastard[Beat].[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
Regardless,[....][N]
he told us we can slaughter the lot,[A][N]
and I am a woman of my word.[A][N]
It's not like their[N]
lives hold any meaning.[A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat].[A][X]


## AB2Opening7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVollster]
That's it, I can't take it any longer![A][N]
Come at me, you barbarians![A][N]
I could use a bit of a warm up![A][X]

## AB2Opening8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle][OpenMidRight][LoadReginald]
Lady Elle, there appears to be a lone[N]
villager fighting off the bandits.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Hm, leave him be.[N]
He'll die a fool's death.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadLazul][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
E-Elle![A][N]
Please, we can't just[N]
let him fight them alone.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
It's none of our business, Lazul.[A][N]
He made his decision;[N]
we have a job to do.[A][X]

## AB2Opening9
[OpenMidRight][LoadVollster]
C'mon, give me a warmup![A][X]

## AB2Opening10
[OpenMidRight][LoadVollster]
Heh![A][N]
If I had known you[N]
were this pathetic,[A][N]
I would've picked up my[N]
tome a long time ago.[A][X]

## AB2Opening11
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle][OpenMidRight][LoadReginald]
He looks strong.[A][N]
Lady Elle, forgive my impertinence,[A][N]
but I don't think we can engage him in[N]
combat without sustaining serious injuries.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Tell me, Reginald,[N]
what do you suggest?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
We should talk to him.[A][N]
Convince him to join our side.[A][N]
You should be the one to do it, though.[A][N]
Lapis cannot approach men,[A][N]
and I am[Beat]not known for my[N]
exceptional conversation skills.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Very well.[A][N]
Let us embark.[A][X]

## AB2AfterKillingFirstEnemy
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRynod]
They're strong[Beat][A][N]
Men! We need some hostages![A][X]

## AB2TalkVollsterElle
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadVollster]
Hmm, you don't look to[N]
be with the bandits.[A][N]
You here to join in[N]
on the beatdown?[A][N]
Please, ladies first.[A][X]

## AB2VollsterNPCDeathQuote
Damn, I must've not[N]
trained enough[Beat]![A][N]
I refuse to let[N]
it all end here![A][X]

## AB2BossQuoteElle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRynod]
Heh, you're just[N]
a little runt.[A][N]
Sure is interesting to[N]
see a woman not dressed[A][N]
from head to toe in furs.[A][N]
Gets awfully[N]
boring around here.[A]

[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadElle]
It's men like you[N]
that I relish killing.[A][X]

## AB2BossQuoteLazul
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRynod]
Oh, my, you're[N]
absolutely stunning.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadLazul]
Eep![A][N]
St-stay away from me![A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadRynod]
C'mere, I can't kill you[N]
without getting closer.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadLazul]
[CloseEyes]
I[Beat]need to[N]
stand my ground[Beat][A][X]

## AB2BossQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRynod]
Hurry up and die![A][X]


## AB2Ending1
[OpenRight][LoadLazul][OpenFarRight][LoadReginald]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle]
Hmph.[....] Cowards.[....][A][N]

Soon as their leader's killed,[N]
they flee like the dastards they are.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
It appears the village really was under[N]
siege from a foreign bandit troupe.[A][N]
They are free now.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Good.[A][N]
Though that begs the question[Beat][A][N]
Who sent them here?[A][N]
This is certainly not a[N]
place one just stumbles upon.[A]

[OpenRight]
Perhaps it's just pure chance?[A][N]
What would anyone want with a[N]
village as nondescript as this?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I am inclined to agree with Lapis,[N]
as much as it pains me to admit.[A]

[OpenRight]
"Pains"[Beat]?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I can see no reason why their[N]
presence would be required here.[A][N]
Not to mention they were weak.[A][N]
Perhaps they were driven out of the[N]
southern territory by stronger bandits,[A][N]
and came here as a result.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm[Beat][A][X]


## ABEnding2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle][OpenMidRight][LoadVollster]
Ah, so we finally have a[N]
chance to properly speak.[A][N]
The name's Vollster.[A][N]
I have to wonder, though,[A][N]
what a bunch of outsiders[N]
are doing at a place like this.[A][N]
You seem too strong to[N]
be a bunch of vagabonds.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed, we're not.[A][N]
I am Elle Alfbern.[A][N]
I was sent here on[N]
assignment from the Council.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
The Blade of the Council?[A][N]
I thought you were just a scary story[N]
mothers told their misbehaving children![A][N]
[Wink]You're not here to kill me, are you?[A][N]
Heh.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
No.[A][N]
Do you know why those[N]
bandits were here?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Hmm, 'fraid not.[A][N]
They've been here for[N]
the last week or so.[A][N]
None of us knew why they were here,[A][N]
but we pretty much had to[N]
accommodate them against our will.[A][N]
Oh, but I found this the night before![A][N]
Their boss dropped it[N]
while passing by my house,[A][N]
and I decided to swipe it.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
A letter[Beat].[A][N]
This has the wax crest of[N]
House Nouveau stamped on it.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
House new-what?[A][N]
Look, that's all fine and dandy,[N]
but that fight made me realize something.[A][N]
I'm way weaker than I thought.[A][N]
Could I maybe join your group?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You wish to join the[N]
Amber Bears Strike Force?[A][N]
You do know of us, right?[A][N]
How we kill people under[N]
request of the Council.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat].[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Don't misconstrue my words;[N]
you're welcome to join.[A][N]
But just know that if you do,[N]
you will be expected to work.[A][N]
To bleed, if it comes to that.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I[Beat]don't really[N]
have much of a choice.[A][N]
Not like I'm gonna get[N]
stronger staying here.[A][N]
I'll follow you now, Leader.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat]We must hurry back.[A][N]
I have the most dreadful feeling.[A][X]
