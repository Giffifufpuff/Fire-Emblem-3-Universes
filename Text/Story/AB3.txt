[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle]
Finally, we're back.[A][N]
It took way too long to return.[A][N]
Does anything seem amiss?[A]
[OpenMidRRight]
No, Lady Elle.[A][N]
Everything seems[N]
to be in order.[A][N]
I've yet to spot anyone[N]
who looks out of place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
All right, let's go.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]
Reginald, you,[....] um,[....] seem[N]
bothered by something.[A]
[OpenRight]
It is nothing, Lapis.[N]
Come, we're needed.[A][X]

## AB3Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAlbinia]
[OpenLeft][LoadBarrymore]
[OpenMidRight][LoadElle]
Councilman Barrymore, I bear--[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Yes?[....][N]
What is it you bear?[A]

[OpenLeft]
Miss Alfbern?[A][N]
What is it?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Councilwoman Nouveau[Beat][A][N]
It is a pleasant[N]
surprise to see you.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Likewise, Miss Elle.[A][N]
Come on, you know I prefer[N]
being on a first name basis.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Oh, yes.[A][N]
Erm, pardon my[Beat][....][N]
bad manners.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Is everything okay?[A][N]
You seem a bit tongue-tied.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
No, no, everything's fine.[A][N]
I'm afraid you just[N]
caught me by surprise.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Yes, you mentioned something[N]
about bearing earlier.[A][N]
What was that whole thing about?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
B-Bearing?[A][N]
Please excuse me, I think[N]
you may have misheard.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
No, I'm pretty sure[N]
that is not the case.[A][N]
Did you hear her[N]
say the same, Lucian?[A]

[OpenLeft]
Er, I don't think so.[A][N]
Who knows what she[N]
could have said?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Beat.[A][N]
Bearing, bearing[Beat][...][N]
Oh my![A]

[OpenMidRight]
What is it?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
I see.[A][N]
Oh, Lucian, you naughty boy![A][N]
With someone so beneath[N]
your station, no less.[A][N]
I'll let you two talk it[N]
out amongst yourselves;[A] this[N]
is a private affair, after all.[A][N]
Don't worry; I won't tell[N] 
anyone your secret.[A][N]
Not like you don't have the[N]
resources to deal with it privately,[A][N]
if you decide not to go public.[A]
[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Urgh, that minx.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Councilman, what was[N]
she going on about?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Nothing true.[A][N]
Let's not dwell on it;[A][N]
tell me what it is you've[N]
had weighing on your tongue.[A][X]

Fade out
Fade in

## AB3Opening3
[OpenFarRight][LoadReginald]
[OpenRight][LoadElle]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarrymore][CloseEyes]
I'm afraid this could be major.[A]

[OpenRight]
What do you mean "could"?[A][N]
It is![A]

[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Albinia was here trying to[N]
get information from me.[A][N]
I fear she might[N]
already know about us.[A][N]
We'd best be careful;[N]
she's planning something.[A]

[OpenRight]
Why did you send us there, though?[A][N]
To Olenvard?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Truth be told, I first heard[N]
the name from Albinia's lips.[A][N]
I overheard her mention it the other[N]
day when exchanging words with a servant.[A][N]
Naturally, I got suspicious;[A][N]
there's no reason for a woman of[N]
her rank to be talking to a servant[A][N]
unless it's something she[N]
wants to keep under wraps.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Well, what are we to do now?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
It would be foolish[N]
to act in haste.[A][N]
We'd best just[N]
stay on our guard.[A][N]
For now, return to[N]
your normal routines.[A][N]
I will send word when I [N]
need something else done.[A][X]


## ABOpening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle]
[OpenMidRight][LoadReginald]
Lady Elle![A][N]
Why have we been[N]
summoned by the Council?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know, Reginald.[N]
We'll have to wait and see.[A][X]


## ABOpening5
[OpenMidRight][LoadElle]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMandel]

Miss Alfbern.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Councilwoman?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
We've summoned you today to answer[N]
some questions for the Council.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
May I ask what brought this on?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Councilwoman Nouveau has brought[N]
something to our attention.[A][N]
Councilwoman?[A]

[MoveLeft][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadNoveau][MoveFarLeft]
Yes.[A][N]
Miss Elle, are you familiar[N]
with this brooch?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat][A] 

[OpenFarLeft]
Ahem.[A][N]
I asked if you're[N]
familiar with this brooch.[A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
That is[Beat][....][A][N]
Mikey's brooch, Councilwoman.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Indeed.[A][N]
One of the servants found it[N]
whilst cleaning your quarters.[A][N]
As you know, Mikey,[....] bless his heart,[...][N]
was murdered some two weeks ago.[A][N]
Do you have anything to say?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]No.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
What was that?[....][N]
Speak up.[A]

[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I said no.[A][N]
However you found this[N]
evidence, it was planted.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Ha! You're a funny one.[A][N]
While it's true that the[N]
brooch could've been planted,[A][N]
it's a bit hard to prove your[N]
innocence when there's traces[A][N]
of the poison used to[N]
kill him on your boots.[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadReginald][MoveFarRight]
Lies![A][N]
You speak lies, Albinia![A]

[OpenLeft]
Reginald Hielvann![A][N]
How dare you raise[N]
your voice in this room?[A][N]
And to a member of[N]
the Council, no less![A]

[OpenFarRight]
I shall not apologize when my[N]
lady is being slandered like--[...][A]

[OpenRight]
Reginald.[....][N]
Silence.[A]

[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat]Very well.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]
What leads you to believe[N]
it wasn't planted as well,[A][N]
along with the brooch?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]

The poison is from Nalonga.[A][N]
At the time of Mikey's murder,[A][N]
you had recently returned from that[N]
very same place three days prior.[A][N]
No one else here has been[N]
there any time recently.[A][N]

I think that is sufficient,[N]
Councilwoman Mandel?[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenLeft][LoadBarrymore]
Councilwoman Mandel, if I may.[A][N]
There is no damning evidence that[N]
connects Miss Alfbern with the murder.[A][N]
As someone whose House always[N]
had a close relationship with Mikey,[A][N]
you know I am as eager[N]
to get vengeance as anyone.[A][N]
Yet I just can't believe--[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Why not?[A][N]
She is an assassin, remember?[A][N]
The Blade of the Council.[A][N]
Turning around and killing one[N]
of our own is hardly unexpected.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Enough![A]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
Councilman Barrymore,[N]
I am afraid I cannot take your word[A][N]
as sufficient evidence to[N]
consider Miss Alfbern innocent.[A]

[OpenRight]
May I ask why?[A]

[OpenLeft]
That harlot sorceress[N]
is in her company.[A][N]
To be brief,[A][N]
I cannot trust the opinion[N]
of any man in this room.[A]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadLazul][CloseEyes]
[Beat][A]

[ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft]

The Council finds Miss Alfbern guilty[N]
of the murder of Mikey Mortis![A][N]
Guards![A][N]
Come escort them to the dungeons![A]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadWhiteSoldier]
Yes, ma'am![A]

[MoveFarFarRight][.....][X]

## AB3Opening6

[OpenFarLeft][LoadLazul]
[OpenMidRight][LoadReginald]
[OpenLeft][LoadElle]

Damn![A][N]
We fell right[N]
into her trap![A][N]
And to make[N]
matters worse,[A][N] 
we're separated from[N]
the other Bears.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Lady Elle, I fear they will[N]
not come to our rescue.[A]

[OpenLeft]
And why is that?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
They have no reason to side[N]
with us in this conflict.[A][N]
It's much easier for[N]
them to cut their losses,[A][N]
since only the three of[N]
us have been indicted.[A]

[OpenLeft]
I should've known.[A][N]
That's what I get[N]
for trusting others.[A][N]
Worthless, all of them.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Elle, I'm so sorry for[N]
hindering you like that,[A][N]
back in the Council room![A][N][CloseEyes]
I will volunteer to[N]
be executed first.[A][N]
It is only right.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Hold on, no one is dying.[A][N]
We can still get out of this.[A][N]
Right, Reginald?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Honestly,[....][N]
I'd say our chances are--[A]

[OpenLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]Right, Reginald?[A][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidRight]
Y-Yes, of course.[A][N]
Fear not, Lapis,[N]
we shall escape.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
I hope you're right.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadBarrymore]
Hello there.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft]
Councilman Barrymore.[A][N]
What are you doing here?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Your friends brought me.[A]

[MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadJack]
Heya![A]

[ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadWilliam]
What's good?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Jack![....] William![....][N]
You really came for us?[A]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadJack]
Of course![A][N]
You're our leader,[N]
are you not?[A][N]
We can't just abandon you[N]
in your time of need.[A]

[OpenRight]
Yes, yes, fine and dandy,[A][N]
but I'm afraid we're[N]
rather short on time.[A][N]
Here, the keys.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Where are you taking us?[A]

[OpenRight]
I'm not taking you anywhere.[A][N]
I am merely opening[N]
the door to freedom.[A][N]
How you go about seizing[N]
it is up to you,[A][N]
Blade of the Council.[A]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadWilliam]
The other Bears are[N]
waiting for us outside.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadReginald]
You mean everyone's here?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Of course.[A][N]
You can't be a coward and[N]
be in the Amber Bears.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLazul][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft][LoadJack]
Ahem.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
EEEK!![A]
[MoveLeft]

[OpenFarLeft]
Haha![A][N]
Well, William's right[N]
for the most part.[A][N]
Now come on:[N]

you all go first.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
But--[A]

[OpenLeft]
No buts.[A][N]
I'm your leader;[A][N]
it's my responsibility to assure[N]
my subordinates' safety before my own.[A][N]
Now go.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat][A][N]
So be it, Lady Elle.[A][N]
I shall be waiting for you[N]
outside the castle walls.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[ClearFace][LoadJack]
An order is an order, I guess.[A][N]
Who am I to disobey?[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[ClearFace][LoadWilliam]
You mustn't dawdle.[A][N]
These dastards could[N]
come after us any minute.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[ClearFace][LoadLazul]
Elle, please, I can't be without you.[A][N]
I'm[Beat]scared.[....] So scared.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Miss Lazul, you will be okay.[A][N]
Here, let me--[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Eep! Get away from me![A][N]
Ack, I'm outta here![A]

[ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight]
Hmph.[N]
Clever trick you did there.[A][N]
I almost have respect for you.[A][N]
Most men would've done more[N]
than just speak to her.[A][N]
The enchantment of her Crest[N]
is a strong one indeed.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I do have to admit, it's not as[N]
if I feel nothing looking at her.[A][N]
Yet it feels oddly hollow.[A][N]
Certainly nothing like the perplexing[N]
feeling I get when looking at--[A][N][CloseEyes]
Er, do not mind me.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Now tell me the catch.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Pardon?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
The catch for saving us.[A][N]
Your payment.[A][N]
People do not help me unless[N]
they want something in return.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh.[A][N]
Well, I ask[N]
nothing in return.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I respectfully request[N]
you do not lie to me.[A][N]
There's always a price.[A][N]
What is your motivation?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, there's that real side of you.[A][N]
I like it a lot more than that[N]
fake, genial mask you wear.[A][N]
You question my motives, despite[N]
having been nobly saved by your Bears.[A][N]
Let's just call my motivation sentiment, hm?[A][N]
Now go, before the both of us are caught[N]
and it's my head on the chopping block.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I do not believe you[Beat][A][N]
But I'm not in a[N]
position to question it.[A][N]
[Beat][A][N]
Thank you, Lucian.[A][X]

[OpenFarRight][LoadLazul]
[OpenRight][LoadReginald]
It appears all of us have[N]
reunited in one piece.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I'm pretty good at[N]
hiding, actually.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Everyone truly is[Beat][....] here.[N]
They're actually here.[A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAdam]
Careful, Elle.[A]
If you're not careful,[A][N]
you might actually end[N]
up shedding a tear.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[ClearFace][LoadAlbinia]
Not so fast.[A][N]
Guards![....][N]
They're over here![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft]
Damn, we've been found out.[A][N]
There's no way we can win[N]
with our paltry numbers.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadZane]
If I may[Beat][A][N]
Might I suggest we make our[N]
way towards the mountain range?[A][N]
Our smaller numbers allow us greater[N]
mobility than Albinia's forces.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
A tactical genius as always, Zane.[A][N]
Everyone, to the mountain range.[A][X]


## AB3Opening9
[OpenRight][LoadZane]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElle]
They have us surrounded.[A][N]
We'll have to break our way past.[A]

[OpenRight]
That man over there.[A}[N]
I believe if we can defeat him,[A][N]
we should have a clear path[N]
to the mountain range.[A]

[OpenFarRight][LoadVollster]
Sounds like a good adversary.[N]
I will challenge him first![A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadLazul]
Are you sure?[A][N]
He doesn't look like[N]
any old guard to me.[A][N]
I'm starting to get nervous.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You're right; he doesn't.[A][N]
But we don't have[N]
a choice, I'm afraid.[A][X]


## AB3Turn1Start
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIlyron]
Hmph.[A][N]
So these are the despicable[N]

It's unfortunate Lucian isn't[N]

I'll make sure to bring[N]
their heads back on pikes.[A][N]
For both my brother and Mikey.[A][X]

## AB3BossQuoteElle

I've been waiting for you,[N]

I'll relish tearing you apart[A][N]

Your treachery ends here.[A]

[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadElle]
You're not the first[N]
to wish me six feet under,[A][N]
and you certainly[N]
won't be the last.[A][N]
But if I had[N]
listened to them,[A][N]

I think we lost them.[A]

[OpenRight]
It appears so.[A][N]
For the time being, we are safe.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
But what are we to do now?[A][N]
We have no place to[N]

We're criminals![A]

Surely Lady Elle has a plan.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat][A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadZane]
You do have a plan, right?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Of course I do.[A][N]
First, we prove ourselves innocent.[A][N]
Then, we get a seat on the Council.[A][N]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadGreg]
While that is all fine and dandy,[A][N]
what is our first[N]
step toward that goal?[A][N]
I'm starting to get irritated.[A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadWilliam]
Me too. Please tell me[N]
you actually have a plan.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I, um[Beat][A]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadLazul]
First we should rest![A][N]
[Beat][A][N]
I mean, um, I suggest that we rest.[A][N]
Look[Beat]there's a village over there.[A][N]
One of us should go ask.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Adam. You should go.[A][N]
You're the most[N]
charismatic of our group.[A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadAdam]
Understood.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft]
What led you to take charge?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
What?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You said we should rest[N]
and go to the village.[A][N]
You seem[Beat][A][N]
oddly calm in the face of[N]
this unexpected situation.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
One step at a time.[A][N]
Worry about today, not tomorrow.[A][N]
I[Beat]had to teach myself[N]
that before coming here.[A][N]
Sometimes, when you're so inundated[N]
with problems that you can't even think,[A][N]
you just shut it all out and[N]
focus on one thing: living.[A][N]
For now, we just need to survive.[A][N]
And while we do that,[N]
we can think about what to do next.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[A][N]
Lazul, I never did ask[N]
you the details about--[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarFarRight][LoadAdam][MoveFarRight]
All right.[A][N]
The elder was kind enough to allow[N]
us shelter for the time being.[A][N]
It will certainly be better[N]
than braving the wilderness.[A][N]
Lady Elle, do you want to lead?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadReginald]
I'll take the lead.[A][N]
Come, let's go.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What is it, Lazul?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Thank you.[A][N]
Because of meeting you,[A][N]
I can look forward to more[N]
than just when my next meal is,[A][N]
or where I'm going to[N]
sleep for the night.[A][N]
You keep trying to distance[N]
yourself from everybody,[A][N]
but all of the Amber[N]
Bears care about you![A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Oh, Lazul, I[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]

We should rest;[A][N]
there's a north[N]

## AB3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarrymore][OpenMidRight][LoadWhiteSoldier]
Sir! I bear news![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You may speak.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
It's your younger brother,[N]
sir, Lord Barrymore.[A][N]
He[Beat][A][N]
was killed trying to apprehend[N]
the Blade of the Council.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You may go.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Sir![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat]Oh, Ilyron, you damned fool.[A][N]
How many times have I told[N]
you not to play the hero?[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadAlbinia]
My, am I interrupting something?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Albinia.[A][N]
I'm afraid I am rather[N]
occupied at the moment.[A][N]
If you would please[N]
leave me be.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes, I've heard the news.[A][N]
It's a shame about Ilyron.[A][N]
You two were always so close.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Don't speak his[N]
name, you wench![A][N]
You're the one who[N]
sent him to his death![A]

[OpenMidRight]
I may have been the one who[N]
called for reinforcements,[A][N]
but it was Ilyron who insisted[N]
on throwing himself into the fray.[A][N]
Not to mention it was Elle[N]
who dealt the finishing blow.[A][N]
You must hate her, no?[A][N]
The girl who stole away not[N]
only a close family friend,[A][N]
but now your baby brother.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
Even more so a shame that[N] 
you're the one who helped her.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What?[....] You speak lies![A]

[OpenMidRight]
No, I don't.[A][N]
I know you did it, Lucian.[A][N]
There is no doubt in my mind.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Even if it were true,[N]
you have no proof.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
That's the thing:[....][N]
I don't need it.[A][N]
You're no fool, Lucian.[A][N]
It's easy to see the[N]
unease in the air.[A][N]
You have no alibi at the[N]
time of the incident.[A][N]
The Council is looking for[N]
someone to blame their woes on.[A][N]
You'll have to prove yourself[N]
innocent, rather than guilty.[A][N]
So you have just as[N]
much proof as I do.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
But your secret's safe with me.[A][N]
After all, this is so much more fun.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What is?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Watching you lose[N]
everything by your own hand.[A][N]
First you lost Mikey by telling[N]
him to investigate me.[A][N]
Then you lost Elle by[N]
sending her to Olenvard.[A][N]
Then last but not least,[A][N]
by freeing them, you inadvertently[N]
sent your brother to his death.[A][N]
Oh, yes, this is way more[N]
fun than simply destroying you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
Anyway, I've come here[N]
to say my piece.[....] Ciao.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
