Lady Elle, I believe[N]
we've arrived.[A]
[MidRight]#Elle
Ugh, smoke! There's so much[N]
smoke everywhere![A]
[FarLeft]#Lazul
D-Do you want me to get you[N]
a honey-infused handkerchief?[A]
[MidRight]#Elle
No, it's fine.[A]

[ML][LoadElle][Right][LoadFace][0x5D][0x01][FarRight][LoadFace][0x5E][0x01]
[Right]
We're not stopping until Hevursa does[N]
something about those poachers![A]
[FR]
Let that stupid Council come here[N]
and stop us if they really care[AN]
so much about our village! They'll[N]
never show up, I guarantee it.[AN]
[Clear][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Eek! It's the Blade of the[N]
Council! Run for your lives![A]
[Right]
No, don't! We mustn't run now[N]
or nothing will change! Hold[AN]
your ground! So long as we[N]
have Kajarn we'll be fine![AN]
[ML]
It would be easier to kill them,[N]
but unfortunately the Council[AN]
insisted that we merely subdue[N]
them with force. Let's wrap[AN]
this up quickly. Reginald,[N]
Lazul, let's go![A]
[Clear][FL][LoadReginald][Left][LoadLazul]
#Might trim out
[FL]#R
I'm with you![A]
[Left]#Lazul
I'm...with you...[A]
[FL]#Reg
What was that, Lapis?[A]
[Left]#Laz
I-I said I'm with you![A][X]

[MidRight]#Elle You're fortunate your heart still beats.
R: Hmph. I shan't let you get in Lady Elle's way.

[Right]#Reginald
Lady Elle, our work here is done.[N]
I know that Kajarn's death wasn't[AN]
our goal, but there's nothing to[N]
be done about it now.[A]
[FR]
Um, I think you two[N]
should see this.[A]
[FR][Clear][Right][Clear][ML][Clear]
[FL][LoadReginald][Left][LoadElle][Right][LoadFace][0x5D][0x01][FarRight][LoadFace][0x5E][0x01]
[Right]
The Blade of the Council killed[N]
Kajarn! Is this what the Council[AN]
is planning to do with us too?[N]
Are we really so worthless to them?[AN]
[FarRight]
Monster![A]
[Clear][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Murderer![A]
[Right]
Leave us now, you beast! If you're[N]
going to slaughter us then do so[AN]
without delay! Kajarn's death[N]
will not be in vain![A]
[FarLeft]#Reg
I'll do something about[N]
their treacherous words.[A]
[Left]#Elle
Reginald. ...I think it's best[N]
we go before things worsen.[A]
[FarLeft]#Reg
But-[A]
[Left]#Elle
Let's go. Now.
[....]
[FarLeft]#Reg
Very well.[A][X]

## AB1Ending2
[MidRight][LoadElle][FL][LoadReginald][Left][LoadLazul]
[MidRight]#Elle
So much for garnering the Council's[N]
favor. No doubt I'm going to be[AN]
reprimanded when we return.[A]
[FarLeft]#Reginald 
No need to stress.[N]
We still have plenty of time to[AN]
improve your image. This shall[N]
only be temporary.[A]
[Left]#Lazul
Do you think Jacquine village[N]
will get the help it needs?[A]
[FarLeft]#Reginald 
Should you really be wasting your[N]
time thinking about that, Lapis?[A]
[Left]#Lazul
Eek![A]
[....]
[FarLeft]#Reginald 
[CloseEyes]
I...suppose they might. It's impossible[N]
to say right now.[OpenEyes] What I will say,[AN]
though, is that we still accomplished[N]
our main objective: to subdue the[AN]
rebellion. We should take pride in that.[A]
[MidRight]#Elle
...[A] 
[Left]#Lazul
...[A]
[FarLeft]#Reginald 
[CloseEyes]
I'll go scout ahead.[A]
[ClearFace]
[Left]#Lazul
Elle? Is everything okay?[A]
[MidRight]#Elle
What? Of course, Lazul.[N]
No need to worry over me.[A]
[Left]#Lazul
Right, of course. Sorry for[N]
bothering you...[A]
[Clear]
[MidRight]#Elle
...
[CloseEyes]Why did that fool[N]
insist on dying?[A][X]

## AB1ReginaldLazulTalk
R: Lapis!
L: Eep! Y-You scared me, Reginald.
R: You say that every time I speak to you though.
L: I...guess you're right about that.
R: Anyway, I approached you because I heard from Elle that you were wondering how I'm so imposing when I speak.
L: *closes eyes* Those conversations were...supposed to be private...
R: Pardon?
L: *open eyes* Um, nothing.
R: As I was saying, I figured now was a good time to discuss since it's your first time on the frontlines and all.
L: What does me being on the frontlines have to do with anything?
R: Well, you know, it's to ease stress. Stress can be dangerous on the battlefield.
L: Do you actually...care about me?
R: Hm? Whatever it was you said, I didn't hear it, Lapis.
L: *closes eyes* My name is Lazul...[X]
