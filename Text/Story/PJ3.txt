## PJ3OpeningNarration
During the absence of the von[N]
Siegfrieds, Seraphyn has been[N]
going through rough times.[A][N]
Arxhat's intention to declare[N]
war on the Novingale Empire split[N]
the Seraphs in twain. With Arxhat's[N]
dominion over the Seraphyn military,[A][N]
Vergil's loyalists have been imprisoned[N]
or executed. The Purple Jaguars head to[N]
Theronca, a loyalist town recently[N]
subjugated by Arxhat's forces,[A][N]
hoping to finally turn the tide[N]
against Arxhat...[A][X]


## PJ3Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDarach]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Darach![A][N]
Lieutenant Bruckner has gone missing,[A][N]
and his search party has[N]
not reported back in two days.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
So he's been defeated.[A][N]
Damn that Vergil![N]
How are his men so slippery?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I don't know, Commander.[A][N]
We've sent out squad[N]
after squad after him,[A][N]
but the Prince still[N]
manages to evade capture.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well, it matters not.[A][N]
Bruckner was gullible, nothing[N]
more than a deluded minion.[A][N]
Losing him doesn't change anything[N]
in the grand scheme of things.[A][N]
[Beat]In the meantime,[N]
what are the peasants up to?[A][N]
Do they still resist King Arxhat's rule?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
They're still quite adamant about that.[AN]
However, capturing their little resistance[N]
group certainly helped to shut them up.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Theronca still refuses to[N]
accept Arxhat's new Seraphyn.[A][N]
How regretful.[A][N]
They'll soon see,[N]
those beguiled plebs.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]
By the way, Commander.[A][N]
It seems that the resistance[N]
believes that Vergil is still alive,[A][N]
lurking in the nearby forests.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Hmph.[A][N]
They might have some[N]
valuable information[Beat][A][N]
Have you interrogated them yet?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
No, Commander,[N]
but why do you ask?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Good. Bring me to them.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A][X]


## PJ3Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDarach]#Darach
[OpenLeft][LoadRedSoldier]

Here they are, Commander.[A][N]
It was hard squeezing all[N]
these dissidents into the cells.[A][N]
Hell, one of them's from Novingale![A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Oh? Which one?[A]

[OpenLeft]
That girl in the[N]
hunter's garb, right there.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Girl? I don't see-[.......]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLenato]
Right here, Seraph.[A]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[Beat] Oh, you're the one.[A][N]
So, you resistance forces are[N]
sheltering the former Prince Vergil.[A][N]
Novingale scum.[N]
You'd better tell me where he is.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I can't.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You refuse to reveal his whereabouts?[N]
You're testing my patience, wench![A]

[OpenMidRight]
None of us know any better[N]
than you soldiers do -[A][N]
After all, Prince Vergil[N]
is killing them.[A][N]
Don't bother asking us.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
You think you can[N]
make a fool out of me?[A][N]
I'll warn you one more time.[A][N]
Once I'm back, you rebels[N]
better give me a proper answer.[A][N]
You won't like what[N]
will happen if you don't.[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]

[Beat][A][ClearFace]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDarach][OpenMidRight][LoadAugustus]
Hey, you![A][N]
You're leading these brutes, right?[A][N]
Let me out of here![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What in the- who are you?[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
That boy?[A][N]
We found him lurking about the fort[N]
just the other day and captured him.[A][N]
Just look at him![A][N]
That's certainly not[N]
someone from Seraphyn.[A][N]
I think he's a spy from Novingale.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Novingale?[....] Spy?[....][N]
You're kidding, aren't you?[A][N]
I'm just a travelling priest.[N]
I'm innocent![A]

[OpenLeft]
Make this simple for us, boy.[N]
Where are you from?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
That[Beat][N]
I'm not sure.[A]

[OpenLeft]
[Beat]Are you trying to be funny?[A][N]
You claim you're a travelling priest,[N]
but you don't know where you came from?[A][N]
How do you expect us to[N]
believe such a bad lie?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Well, I can't remember-[A][N][CloseEyes]
Sheesh, I'm going back to bed.[N]
I'm tired of arguing with you savages.[A]
[OpenEyes][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft]
Tch[Beat] Something's[N]
off about that boy.[A][N]
Novingale spy or not,[N]
he's suspicious enough.[A][N]
Continue detaining him,[N]
until he gives up his little act.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
As for the rebels, sir?[A][N]
What if they do relent and[N]
give us the information we need?[A]

[OpenLeft]
Kill them anyway![A][N]
That Novingale wench[N]
thinks she's so clever -[A][N]
it'll be a great[N]
pleasure killing her![A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Understood, Commander.[A][N]
I'll be making arrangements[N]
for their execution, then.[A][X]


## PJ3Opening3

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBelmonte][OpenRight][LoadLenato][OpenFarRight][LoadPurpleSoldier]
That damned Darach![A][N]
None of us know anything about[N]
Prince Vergil's whereabouts![A][N]
What are we supposed to do?![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Even if we did know,[N]
it's not like he'd spare us.[A]

[OpenRight]
Belmonte, you know the[N]
Prince's whereabouts?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I guessed he was in the[N]
cave systems in the nearby forests.[A][N]
I wasn't sure if I was correct,[A][N]
but I still told the boy to[N]
go check there, since he kept[A][N]
pressuring me for information.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Anton?[A][N]
It's been nearly a week now.[N]
He's probably dead.[A]

[OpenRight]
Or he actually found the Prince.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
If that's the case,[N]
score one for me, then.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
And what use is that?[N]
We're going to die, regardless.[A][N]
Unless a miracle happens[Beat][A][X]

## PJ3Opening4
[OpenFarLeft][LoadStephen][OpenLeft][LoadKhris][OpenFarRight][LoadVergil][OpenRight][LoadHorus]
We've arrived at Fort[N]
Theronca, Lord Vergil.[A][N]
Seems like the loyalists are[N] 
still being kept inside.[A][N]
Stephen, Khris.[A][N]
Do you have anything[N]
we should know?[A]

[OpenLeft]
I know nothing of sorts.[A][N]
Maybe you should ask someone[N]
who's familiar with this area[A][N]
instead of a wanderer like me.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Well, I know that there[N]
are foes inside the fort![A][N]
Is that good enough?[A]

[OpenRight]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadAnton]

Well, for starters,[N]
Darach has to be inside.[A][N]
He'd never pass up the chance[N]
to terrorise his victims.[A]

[OpenRight][OpenEyes]
Darach?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, well[Beat][A][N]
He's the commander in[N]
charge of Theronca.[A]

[MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadKhris]
You seem to be quite[N]
familiar with him, Anton.[A]

[OpenLeft]
He's hated by the peasants here.[A][N]
Following Arxhat's coup,[N]
he forced the villagers to[A][N]
levy heavy taxes for a[N]
large-scale war against Novingale.[A][N]
If they refuse, they die.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
How loathsome[Beat][A][N]
So most of the people here[N]
should be supporting us?[A]

[OpenLeft]
Correct. When we've liberated[N]
Theronca from its oppressors,[A][N]
I imagine the people will be[N]
more than happy to aid our cause.[A][N]
It'll be our first step to[N]
retaking your birthright.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
So this is the perfect time[N]
to show ourselves, then?[A][N]
I like the sound of that.[A][N]
Purple Jaguars! Storm the fort![A][X]

## PJ3Opening5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDarach][OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Darach![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What is it now?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
It's the Prince![A][N]
His forces are[N]
attacking the fortress![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh? Bahahaha! What fools![A][N]
Our prey, walking[N]
right into our jaws?![A][N]
They must be longing for death![A][N]
Very well, then![A][N]
All troops, to formation![A][X]

## PJ3Opening6

[OpenMidLeft][LoadVergil][OpenMidRight][LoadHorus]
Lord Vergil, it's paramount that[N]
we free the loyalists quickly.[A][N]
They might be willing to fight for us,[N]
and if we had some spare weapons[Beat][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps the armory has some,[A][N]
or we can simply take[N]
the weapons off our foes.[A][N]
But our highest priority currently[N]
is to ensure the loyalists' safety![A][N]
Move out, everyone![A][X]


## PJ3PostPrepScreenCaptured

Not all of us managed to[N]

#*Screen fades to black. Vergil and Horus are seen in the throne room, with Darach beside the throne*

#(Show VERGIL [MidLeft] and Darach [MidRight]

#Darach: [eyes half-closed] Guh... 

#Vergil: Commander Darach. Do you truly believe that you fight for a better Seraphyn?

#Darach: What kind of question... is that? â€˜Course I do. Arxhat is the King we need...

#(Show HORUS [FarLeft])

#Horus: The King that Seraphyn needs? What good king would justify abusing his own subjects?!

#Vergil: Horus, peace! I need more answers out of him.

#Darach: Kid, you don't get it, do you...? None of you do... Novingale's aggression grows with every passing day. And what does your father do, Vergil? He refused to stand up... to their insult.

#Vergil: He didn't want to force a meaningless war. Doesn't Arxhat intend on razing Novingale to the ground?

#Darach: ...He does. But he's not a madman... Heh. There are many others who support him. [closes eyes] You just won't understand. You're too sheltered to... ...

#(Clear DARACH and his body)

#Vergil: ...he's dead.

#Horus: [eyes closed] And we still have so many questions... 

#Vergil: ...Arxhat, just what do you want? My parents, Orion, and the people... how many more have to die to see your vision through?

#Horus: At this rate, who knows anymore?

#Xenith (offscreen): Lord Vergil!

#(Horus moves to [FarRight], Vergil moves to [MidRight]. Xenith runs on-screen to [MidLeft])

#Horus: Xenith. What are you doing here?

#Xenith: It appears the villagers want to see your face? They're quite restless.

#Horus: Milord?

#Vergil: ...I see. Well, I can't blame them. It's been two months since that awful incident - they must be sick of staring at Arxhat's ugly mug.

#Xenith: Rightfully so... [closes eyes] I lose my appetite even thinking about him in regal garb.

#*Scene changes to outside Fort Theronca. Vergil leaves the fortress to see an audience of civilians.*

#(Show CIVILIAN #1 [MidLeft], CIVILIAN #2 [FarLeft], VERGIL [MidRight])

#Civilian #1 [money man]: He's here! The rightful prince, he's come to save us!

#Civilian #2 [old lady]: It's a miracle! Arxhat's goons attack our town, and Prince Vergil sends them running back to the capital?

#Vergil: Well, I...

#(Show HORUS [FarRight])

#Horus: Don't get your tongue tied up, milord. [smiles] It's your time to shine.

#Vergil: Yes, of course. [.] My people, we have all suffered under Arxhat's reign - a reign built from our corpses. Arxhat claims to be leading Seraphyn to a new era, but the path he wishes to take will only drive us to ruin! He knew that we true Seraphs would oppose him, so he hired assassins to kill my parents, and from there, sneaked his way into our Sacred Throne! Fellow Seraphs! Together, we can put an end to Arxhat's lunacy!

#Civilian #2: Uh, well, â€˜together'? What can we villagers do? We're just a buncha rebels.

#(STEPHEN appears [FarRight], replacing HORUS)

#Stephen: Fate has finally shifted in favour of the loyalists! In this war, we are no longer rebels! We are heroes of Seraphyn!

#Civilian #1: Hey, I remember your face... aren't you from that dishonored house? Redharr, I think? What's a traitor doing here?

#(XENITH replaces STEPHEN.)

#Xenith: For now, it matters not. We may come from different realms, or from different classes, but we are all united by our desire to free Seraphyn from Arxhat's clutches.

#Vergil: Indeed. The Purple Jaguars have proven their loyalty to the cause, and I know I can trust them. We might not have the equipment of the Seraph knights. However, we have one thing Arxhat lacks: the support of the masses. I know there are many other towns disgruntled by Arxhat's tyranny. My people, if we combine all our forces, we can form an army Arxhat will fear!

#Lenato: No, it's okay. He died believing in your cause, prince. A few lives lost to save many more... it's not a bad exchange.
